# P2 - Einsteins Portfolio
Welcome to our portfolio! Here you can find quick access to all our important achievements throughout Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles.

## Git Instructions
* You can learn about running this project on your IDE in this section:
* Go to Code home and click on the green "Code" button.
* Click on the clipboard next to the Git url. 
* Open up your IntelliJ and click "Run from Version Control".
* Press "Ctrl + V" or "âŒ˜ + V" and press the blue "Clone" button at the bottom.
* Once the project is opened up, be sure to change the interpreter to Python 3.8 or above. 
* Run the project from main.py and you're all set!

## Python Fundamentals
* Our learning begins with our very first project, "Python Fundamentals". In this project we learned lots about strings, variables, assignments, iterations, and much more fundamental pieces of Python. 
* As we built our understanding of this language, we were able to develop very creative and powerful programs.
* Click on the Repl Repository to view our fundamentals project. How to use the program and all code explanations can be found on the README.md file of that program.
* Click on the Project Padlet to learn more about our initial planning and what we strived to build as a group
* Click on Resources to view feedback from our instructor as well as our reflection at the end of the project. All links that are relevant to our project can be found in that document as well.

## Calculator Project
* With our second project, we have a better idea of what we want to deliver. We strive to build a website using HTML and JavaScript as the frontend and Python as the backend to display a series of intuitive and easy to use calculators for various applications of math.
* Click on the Github Repository to view our commits and the final product which is currently under development. 
* Click on the Project Padlet to view our initial thoughts on the project and our plans for what we may be including in this project. This project is currently under development so there may be minor discrpancies with the padlet. Stay tuned!
* For a more in depth code breakdown, visit the project's respective Git Repository and learn more under its README.md

# Project Log
* **11/10/20**: Dropdown menu wasn't fixed and is still bugging. All other mechanisms are working and project page is well refined. POST will eventually be added to the project page, it is currently under testing and being contemplated wether a login for a portfolio will be necessary. It is most unlikely that we will include this login, but we will surely integrate some kind of POST. We are currently thinking, POST in the form of contacting developers?
  * Goals: Fix dropdown menu before 11/15? Integrate POST in some form.
* **11/5/20**: Looping; the team worked together to find a looping method. A youtube playlist of a video was created and then linked with an embed link. Then, specific syntax with loop=1 could be added in order to keep looping the video. This change was done to fit requirements for the individual showcase due Friday. It's highly unlikely the team will work out the dropdown menu by Friday, but we will keep trying.
  * Goals: Fix dropdown menu before Friday?
* **11/4/20**: Finally fixed Vanta! The the design populates the entire screen now. It just occassionally bugs out and squashes, but reloading fixes it. Created new journals menu where all the journals in the group are embedded for ease of access and ease of use. Jinja variables applied to the projects.py and brought forth to base.html to populate any variables that require links for our embeds. 
  * Goals: Fix dropdown menu before Friday?
* **11/3/20**: Learned embedding with class lectures and will start embedding just run windows. Learned about different types of ebmedding including embedding with just run windows, edit windows on google docs, and much more. More complex embedding with managing window sizes and different levels of interaction can now be managed and will be implemented into the website
  * Goals: Vanta still needs fixing, add more embeds with newer techniques. Manage embeds with Jinja on the projects.py page.
* **11/1/20**: Started embedding and playing around with embedding. Started by embedding repl and testing the <iframe></iframe>. Easy to use and managebale to have calculator tied to a run window. Some drawbacks include timing out and the necessity to restart the run every time
  * Goals: Embed just the run window and have a bunch of other parts of the project embedded to the website. Journals and Padlets will be next.
* **10/28/20**: Refined parts of Jinja and utilized dictionaries and pulling data from the projects.py file a bit better. Used more pulls and used more variables to streamline workflow and create seamless transition between html and backend files. 
  * Goals: Fix the vanta's extension down to populat all the area in the website. It is also shrinking down and messing up the buttons, it seems to be causing more problems recently so it is surely a candidate for our next bug fix. Dropdown menu is in the works, however, parts of it are not working so for now it is just a trial.
* **10/21/20**: Errors with boostrap causing Internal Server Errors. Half of the team is working on fixing up the vanta and the other half is working on the boostrap server errors. The navbar was switched out from a search bar to a regular navbar. Dropdown menu for the navbar coming in the near future.
  * Goals: Fix the vanta's extension down to populate all the area in the website. Add dropdown menu as a part of navbar in the future. 
* **10/20/20**: So far along this portfolio project, we have learned about Flask in general, routing from python files to the frontend html files, a bit about Jinja and its templating abilities that are extremely helpful in organizing the information that goes on our website and where each piece of information should go. We have also been taught how to use GitHub and integrate it with IntelliJ for version management and moving away from GitHub. 
  * Goals: Perfect the vanta as it's poorly working. We also have goals to add a better bootstrap menu that is a bit more personalized and has attention to detail such as maybe a search bar or a dropdown menu
