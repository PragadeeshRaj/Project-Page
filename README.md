# P2 - Einsteins Portfolio
Welcome to our portfolio! Here you can find quick access to all our important achievements throughout Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles.
## Git Instructions
* You can learn about running this project on your IDE in this section:
* Go to Code home and click on the green "Code" button.
* Click on the clipboard next to the Git url. 
* Open up your IntelliJ and click "Run from Version Control".
* Press "Ctrl + V" or "âŒ˜ + V" and press the blue "Clone" button at the bottom.
* Once the project is opened up, be sure to change the interpreter to Python 3.8 or above. 
* Run the project from main.py and you're all set!
## Python Fundamentals
* Our learning begins with our very first project, "Python Fundamentals". In this project we learned lots about strings, variables, assignments, iterations, and much more fundamental pieces of Python. 
* As we built our understanding of this language, we were able to develop very creative and powerful programs.
* Click on the Repl Repository to view our fundamentals project. How to use the program and all code explanations can be found on the README.md file of that program.
* Click on the Project Padlet to learn more about our initial planning and what we strived to build as a group
* Click on Resources to view feedback from our instructor as well as our reflection at the end of the project. All links that are relevant to our project can be found in that document as well.
## Calculator Project
* With our second project, we have a better idea of what we want to deliver. We strive to build a website using HTML and JavaScript as the frontend and Python as the backend to display a series of intuitive and easy to use calculators for various applications of math.
* Click on the Github Repository to view our commits and the final product which is currently under development. 
* So far along our project we have included various aspects of our Jinja, Boostrap, as well as console integration into the website. To learn more about the technicalities please visit out Git Repository where you can learn more about these specific pieces of the website through code comments. 
* Click on the Project Padlet to view our initial thoughts on the project and our plans for what we may be including in this project. This project is currently under development so there may be minor discrpancies with the padlet. Stay tuned!
