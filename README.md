# Scientific Calculator
This is our Scientific Calculator base. Here we develop the simple as well as the more complex functions of a scientific calculator.
## Four Functions
* We start with the basic four functions: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
* We mainly rely on variable assignments which we later print using python's math system. 
* We are currently unable to do order of operations due to the limitations in a text based interface. Soon a GUI is definately needed and will be integrated into a website to create an optimal calculator experience.
## Trigonometric Functions
* Much easier that they seem, python has the intutive math function in which we can import all trig functions from. 
* We can assign variables to the user's input and the program will output an answer in radians. This is extremely easy to build and intutive as well. 
* The next goal is to put these basic components into a robust GUI of a calculator for ease of use.
